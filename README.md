   Place the `rs_outfitbag` folder in your FiveM server's `resources` directory.

2. **Configure `server.cfg`**  
   Add the following line to your `server.cfg` to ensure the resource starts:
   ```bash
   ensure rs_outfitbag
   ```

3. **Dependencies**

   - **ox_inventory**: Required for item checks.
   - **lib.progressCircle**: For progress animations.
   - **illenium-appearance** (Optional): For the outfit menu.

## Configuration

### Debugging
Set `Config.Debug = true` to enable detailed logs for troubleshooting.

### Appearance System
- `Config.Appearance = 'illenium'`: Use Illenium Appearance system.
- Change to `'custom'` or `'fivem'` to use a different system or customize.

### Notification System
- `Config.Notify = 'ox'`: Use `ox_notify` for alerts.
- Set to `'rsscripts'` or `'custom'` for other notification systems.

### Command
- Command to place bags: `/outfitbag`  
- Enable or disable the command in `Config.Command`.

### Interaction Range
Set `Config.Distance` to control how close players need to be to interact with the bag.

### Bag Item
The item required to place bags can be configured:
```lua
Config.Item = {
    enabled = true,
    item = 'outfitbag' -- Name of the item
}
```

### Bag Prop
The 3D model used for the outfit bag:
```lua
Config.Prop = 'bkr_prop_duffel_bag_01a'
```

## Usage

### Place a Bag
1. Ensure the player has the required item (`outfitbag` by default).
2. Use the `/outfitbag` command or trigger the `rs_outfitbag:place` event.

### Open a Bag
Approach the placed bag and interact with it using the target system (`ox_target`).

### Pick Up a Bag
Approach the placed bag and interact with it to pick it up.

---

## Events

### Client Events
- `rs_outfitbag:open`: Opens the outfit bag interface.
- `rs_outfitbag:placed`: Triggered when a bag is placed.
- `rs_outfitbag:pickedup`: Triggered when a bag is picked up.

### Server Events
- `rs_outfitbag:placedBag`: Handles server-side logic when a bag is placed.
- `rs_outfitbag:pickedupBag`: Handles server-side logic when a bag is picked up.

## Debugging

Set `Config.Debug = true` to enable console prints. Look for messages prefixed with `[RS Outfit Bag | DEBUG]` to track actions and troubleshoot issues.

---

## Customization

### Notifications
Customize notifications in the `notify` function:
```lua
function notify(title, desc)
    -- Add your own notification logic here
end
```

### Appearance System
Support for custom appearance systems can be added in the `openAppearance` function:
```lua
function openAppearance()
    if Config.Appearance == 'custom' then
        -- Add your custom appearance logic here
    end
end
```

---

## Known Issues
- Ensure dependencies are correctly installed and configured.
- Interaction range (`Config.Distance`) might need tuning for your use case.
